# Project Echo Chamber

A fullstack media streaming service that can be deployed anywhere!

## Dev: Getting Started

To get started writing code you must first build dev-database Docker Image. This can be done by running `yarn db:build`. With the Docker Image built a local development server can be booted up using `yarn dev`. This will let you modify code in both the client and server applications and have changes hot-reload.

**NOTE:** You only need to run `yarn db:build` once unless you make any changes to the dev-database Docker Image.
